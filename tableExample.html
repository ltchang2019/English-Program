	<h1>AJAX Practice</h1>
	
	<p>To finish this challenge, you must take the <strong>username</strong> 
		entered in the form and use it to show all data from the 
		<strong>users</strong> table that relates to this user. This page 
		should not trigger the browser to load a new page; use AJAX to 
		load the new information from a PHP page on the server. The PHP page 
		that you invoke should return the data in a format of your choosing 
		but should include all data for that user. The returned data should 
		show up in the red-bordered div below with an id of "reportArea".
	</p>
	
	<p class="highlight">Due: end of period. Turn in what you have 
		accomplished. Email me your copy of this file and the PHP file that 
		sends back the user data. You can work in pairs but only need to submit
		one email (include your partner's name if you are the one emailing me).
	</p>
	
	<form action="javascript:sendIt();" method="GET">
		Username: <input type="text" name="username" id="username"></input>
		<br>
		<input type="submit"></input>
	</form>
	
	<div id="reportArea"></div>
	
	<script>
		function sendIt() {
			/*	This is just here to give you a start...you probably want to
				delete the contents of this, but don't forget the importance
				of checking data along the way...
			*/
			//alert a "we got this working so far" message
			alert("so far, so good...");
			
			//now set the content of the div to the content of the input field
			document.getElementById("reportArea").innerHTML = 
							document.getElementById("username").value;
